Then you can reactivate the Internet connection and add a password to the account, as well as make all other settings. 

* Alternative Workaround that should remain feasible, more trouble than the simple above command:
1. If the Internet is disabled, you start the reinstallation of Windows 11. You get to the window: "Unfortunately you have lost the Internet connection". From here it starts. Replace "User Name" with whatever you wish to use for the account: 
2. Press Shift + F10 to open the Command Prompt.
3. net.exe user "User Name" /add 
4. net.exe localgroup "Administrators" "User Name" /add
