Binding qBittorrent to an interface

The first step is to bind qBittorrent to the Mullvad network interface to prevent it from leaking your IP in some situations.
Windows

    Start the Mullvad app and connect to a location.

    Open qBittorrent.

    Click on Tools > Options... > Advanced.

    Change Network interface to Mullvad.

    Click on OK.

    Click on File > Exit and then start qBittorrent again.

    Continue with the steps in the next section.

    Click on BitTorrent.

    Check Enable anonymous mode.

    Uncheck (disable) Enable DHT.

    Uncheck (disable) Enable PeX.
